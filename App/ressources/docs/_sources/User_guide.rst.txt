Wizard Site
===========

Once **Wizard** is downloaded and installed, you need to set the location of the *Wizard Site*. The *Wizard Site* contains user and project data necessary for the operation of the pipeline.

.. note::
  If your working on network and want to allow a multi-user work around your projects you must create the *Wizard Site* on this network and ensure that all the future user have an acess to this folder.
.. warning::
  It's important to choose the location of the Site correctly: once the datas are created within this folder by **Wizard**, they will not have to be deleted to ensure optimal operation of the pipeline.

To choose the location of the *Wizard Site*, fill in the text field provided by the path of the folder of your choice and click on accept.

Set the name of your project.
Set the password of your project. Adding a password to a project ensure that any user who want to connect to a project may have an authorization from one of the user already connected to the project.

Set the project path of your project. 

.. note::
  If your working on network and want to allow a multi-user work around your projects you must choose a path on this network and ensure that all the future users have an acess to this folder.

Set the frame rate and the frame format.

*Merging* a project in the *Wizard Site* is very usefull. It can be necessary if you're receiving a Wizard project from a third person or if the link between a project you ave created and Wizard has been broken. This project won't be available, to be connect on, in your project list. 

In the *project* tab, click on *merge*: The merge project window will open. 

*Copy/Paste* the project location in the text box, add the project password and confirm it. Wizard will then process the *merge* and your project will be available from the *project tab* of the **Wizard UI**.

.. warning::
  Beware, *merging* a project required that this project has been made under the *same version* of you *Wizard version*. If not, it may result in data loss.


Softwares Settings
==================

After creating your user and a project, you are ready to start using **Wizard**.

Before creating an asset, you must fill in the software paths in the *software settings*. The location of each software depends on the installation you have done.

In this example, we are setting Autodesk Maya 2020.

You can also add *environnment variables* and *custom scripts* paths. They will be loaded when you launch the software from the **Wizard Launcher**.

.. image:: _images/user_guide_softwares_setting_editing_path_01.png

.. note::
  The *software settings* are written in the *project settings*. Each user connected to your project must have the **same software installation**. This ensure the *Launcher* to work. It is recommended to do a default installation of your software in order to guarantee the same software location between each user. *Make sure each user have an access to the custom scripts and have the same environment variables set in this windows otherwise they won't be loaded*.  

Working with Assets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once **Wizard** is configured you're ready to work on your asset.

As shown in the outliner, Wizard dissociates several parts of your production. The *Asset* part of the *Outliner* is one of the fourth major production part. It contains all the production stages from the *design* to the *look development*, trough *design*, *modeling*, *texturing*, *grooming*, and *rig*.

Create an Asset
===============

Let's create your first *character*. 

To do this, deploy the *asset* tab of the outliner, then the*character* tab. 

To add a character asset to your project click *new*.

**Wizard** has created your character, meaning, now it knows that this asset exist. As you can see, all the production stages (from the design to the shading) are now ready to be created. It also send a pop-up message, regarding the creation, to all users connected on the project.
