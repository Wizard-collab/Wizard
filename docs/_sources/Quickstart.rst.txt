=============
Create a site
=============

First of all, wizard will ask you to create a "site". It is a folder where wizard will store projects and users informations. If you plan to work in team, you have to set the site in a shared drive, else, the path doesn't matter. We recommend to never touch manually this folder.

.. danger:: Modifying files in this directory without a full knowledge can corrupt all the projects stored in wizard. It is strongly recommended to never touch 
  files in this directory !
